Task scheduling plays a crucial role in optimizing resource utilization and improving overall performance in cloud computing ¹. Effective task scheduling is essential to ensure that the cloud resources are utilized efficiently. Traditional task scheduling algorithms often rely on static heuristics or manual configuration, limiting their adaptability and efficiency ². 

Recent research has proposed various methods to optimize task scheduling in cloud computing. For instance, a deep reinforcement learning-based task-scheduling algorithm called DRLBTSA has been proposed that outperforms other algorithms in terms of makespan and resource utilization ³. Another research article proposes different versions of the heuristic-based algorithm Heterogeneous Earliest Finish Time (HEFT) for task scheduling in cloud computing. The authors claim that their approach performs better than other frameworks in terms of schedule length ¹. 

A review article provides an overview of various task scheduling algorithms used in cloud computing. The article discusses the importance of task scheduling and highlights the strengths and weaknesses of different algorithms ⁴. Another research article provides a taxonomy of various nature-inspired scheduling approaches in cloud computing. The article classifies different approaches based on the scheduling algorithm, the nature of the scheduling problem, the type of task, the primary scheduling goal, the task-resource mapping scheme, the scheduling constraint, and the testing .

In summary, task scheduling is a critical component of cloud computing that can significantly impact the performance of the system. Recent research has proposed various methods to optimize task scheduling in cloud computing, including deep reinforcement learning-based algorithms and heuristic-based algorithms such as Heterogeneous Earliest Finish Time (HEFT). A review article provides an overview of various task scheduling algorithms used in cloud computing, while another research article provides a taxonomy of various nature-inspired scheduling approaches in cloud computing.
